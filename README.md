Welcome to Umayr's NC News! On this site you can view articles relating varying topics such as cooking, coding, and football.

This project was created as part of the Northcoders bootcamp course to demonstrate my abilities using React with the API that I also built during my time on the course.

A minimum of Node v12.8.0 is required to run this project locally.

Below are some instructions to help you get started.

## Step 1

Follow the above link to the github repo and copy the url. Once copied, in your terminal, go into a directory of your choice and use the following cammand in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repo-url-here>
```

## Step 2

Once you have cloned the repo into a directory, open the project in your IDE. Once opened, run the following script to install all the relevant dependencies:

```bash

This will install the following dependencies:

```bash

axios: ^0.19.0
react: ^16.11.0
react-dom: ^16.11.0
react-scripts: 3.2.0

## Step 3

Once you have those dependencies installed you can now run the following command to launch a local version of the web app:

```bash
npm start
```

And that's it! Enjoy.
